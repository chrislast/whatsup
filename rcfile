# We have to turn off the no-name-in-module warning because of how Qt
# installs itself into the the Qt packages; PyLint doesn't know
# anything about this, and so it produces a plethora of warnings.
# too-few-public-methods is disabled as it ignores the public methods
# of the parent class due to a pylint bug
# duplicate-code mostly highlights code in multiple plug-ins that may not co-exist
# in a real application
